Hangman Game Rules:

Welcome to the Hangman game! This engaging word-guessing game offers an exciting challenge for players. Here's a brief overview of the rules:

The objective of the game is for the player to guess the letters of a hidden word. Successful guesses lead to the opportunity to guess another word, while unsuccessful attempts result in the loss of one life.

**How to Play:**
1. The game starts with a hidden word represented by underscores, each underscore denoting a letter in the word.

2. The player guesses letters one at a time, attempting to unveil the hidden word.

3. Correct guesses reveal the positions of the correctly guessed letters in the word.

4. Incorrect guesses lead to the deduction of one life.

5. The player continues to guess until they either successfully reveal the entire word or run out of lives.

6. If the player successfully guesses the word, they earn the chance to guess another word.

7. If the player loses all their lives, the game ends.
